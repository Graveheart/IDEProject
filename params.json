[HadCRUT4 Visualization](https://graveheart.github.io/IDEProject/hadcrut.html)\r\n\r\n### Motivation, method, results and conclusions\r\n1. **Motivation**  \r\n1.1. I have decided to use a line chart as it is best used to track changes over time using equal intervals of time between each data point. In our case we want to show the temperature changes on an early basis. Since early average temperature is sometimes not enough to get a good comparison between different years I have also decided to use seasonal average temperature as an additional categorical attribute. I have chosen to use colors that are easily associated with each season, e.g. grey for winter and yellow for spring. The x and y scales represent the quantitive attributes - temperature and year.\r\n1.2. This visualization was taken from [https://rud.is/projects/hadcrut4/](https://rud.is/projects/hadcrut4/)\r\nWhat I really like about it is that it manages to encode quite a lot of information using different visualization channels. Not only does it use the spatial channels to represent year and temperature but also the beginning and ending of each line as its minimum and maximum temperatures. It also takes advantage of the color channel which is used in two different ways. The first one to represent the year of the line and the second one which is my favourite - to represent the average annual temperature for that line. The average annual temperature's exact value can also be seen from the white dot on every line.\r\n\r\n2. **Method**  \r\nFor both visualizations I am using [*this dataset*](http://data.giss.nasa.gov/tmp/gistemp/STATIONS/tmp_608156140000_14_0/station.txt) which contains the temperatures measured in Sofia, Bulgaria for the years from 1951 to 2016 including. As the origin file was in _txt_ format I had to convert it to another one that is easier to parse. Therefore I replaced the spaces with a comma in order to convert it into a csv file. The csv file itself can be found [*here*](https://graveheart.github.io/IDEProject/data/data.csv).   \r\nThe data has one row for each year which contains monthly, season and yearly temperature averages. The problem with the data is that it contains some lines with values of 999 which I am removing in order not to affect the end results of both charts. \r\n\r\n3.  **Results/discussion**  \r\nThe two visualization provide a very good comparison between the years. As we can see the rise in the temperatures is not very high but it is still noticeable. From 1998 till now the average temperature has almost not dropped below 10&deg; while it is the opposite for the years from 1969 to 1983. The temperature amplitude also seems to have increased which can again be seen for the same period of time -  ~20&deg; to ~25&deg; now. As a whole there are a lot of fluctuations throughout the years so it is difficult to come to other general conclusions from this data only.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nVenelin Banov (@graveheart, pbk644)\r\n",
