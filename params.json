I have decided to use a line chart as it is a good visualization for showing trends and here we have trend for temperature change\r\n2. *Method*\r\n2.1.  The dataset I am using is for the temperatures measured in Sofia, Bulgaria and is for the years from 1951 to 2016 including. As the origin file was in _txt_ format I had to convert it to another one that is easier to parse. Therefore I replaced the spaces with a comma in order to convert it into a csv file. It can be found in *data/data.csv*.   \r\nThe data has one row for each year which contains monthly, season and yearly temperature averages. The problem with the data is that it contains some lines with values of 999 which I am removing in order not to affect the end result of both charts.\r\n3. \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nVenelin Banov (@graveheart, pbk644)\r\n",
